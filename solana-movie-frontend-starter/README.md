# A Custome data application on blockchain.

- In today's project I am working on how to write customer data on the solana blockchain.
- Throughout this project I learned that solana blockchain is stateless.

## What altogether is stateless transactions?

- Absoutly nothing is stored inside the Solana Program.
- It dose not know who the signer are, who devloped it.
- All of this info is stored in programs.

## About this program

- In this program we are building a movie review appliation which take the review and store that data on-chain.
